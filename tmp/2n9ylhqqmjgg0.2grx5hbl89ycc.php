<h1 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;"><?php echo $company_name; ?> Privacy Notice</h1>
<p><?php echo $company_name; ?> knows that you care how  information about you is used and shared. We appreciate your trust that we will  do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>By visiting <?php echo $company_name; ?>,  you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong></p>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">What Personal Information About Customers Does <?php echo $company_name; ?>  Gather?</h3>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps  us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at <?php echo $company_name; ?>.  Here are the types of information we gather.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information You Give Us:&nbsp;</strong>We  receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any  other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you  might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the  information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests,  customizing future shopping for you, improving our interface, and communicating  with you.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Information:&nbsp;</strong>We  receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  For example, like many Web sites, we use &quot;cookies,&quot; and we obtain certain  types of information when your Web browser accesses <?php echo $company_name; ?></li>
    <li><strong>E-mail Communications:&nbsp;</strong>To help  us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation  when you open e-mail from <?php echo $company_name; ?> if your computer supports such capabilities.  We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an  effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</li>
    <li><strong>Information from Other Sources:&nbsp;</strong>We  might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our  account information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">What About Cookies?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your  computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize  your browser.</li>
    <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you  how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser  notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons,  such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the  Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take  advantage of some of <?php echo $company_name; ?>'s essential features, we recommend that  you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our  cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to  Checkout, or use any <?php echo $company_name; ?> products and services that require you  to Sign in.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">Does <?php echo $company_name; ?> Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
<p>Information about our customers is an  important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to  others. We share customer information only as described below and with  subsidiaries <?php echo $company_name; ?>, Inc. controls that either are subject to this  Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in  this Privacy Notice.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:&nbsp;</strong>We work  closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace and  Auctions sellers, these businesses sell offerings to you at <?php echo $company_name; ?>.  In other cases, we provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these  businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions,  and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third  party.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:&nbsp;</strong>We  employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive  information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing  assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and  links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They  have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may  not use it for other purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotional Offers:&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes  we send offers to selected groups of <?php echo $company_name; ?> customers on behalf of  other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and  address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer  Communication Preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:&nbsp;</strong>As we  continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or  business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of  the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any  pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents  otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that <?php echo $company_name; ?>, Inc., or  substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of  course be one of the transferred assets.</li>
    <li><strong>Protection of <?php echo $company_name; ?> and Others:&nbsp;</strong>We  release account and other personal information when we believe release is  appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and  other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of <?php echo $company_name; ?>,  our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies  and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously,  however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise  disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial  purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
    <li><strong>With Your Consent:&nbsp;</strong>Other  than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might  go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share  the information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We work to protect the security of your information during  transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts  information you input.</li>
    <li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers  when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number  to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</li>
    <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access  to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using  a shared computer</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>
<p>Our site may include third-party advertising  and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable  customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>
<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or  Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use  technology to send (or &quot;serve&quot;) the advertisements that appear on our  website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address  when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also  known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure  the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do  not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use,  and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are  not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more  information about their privacy practices.</p>
<p><?php echo $company_name; ?> may also display targeted  advertising based on personal information about users. Although <?php echo $company_name; ?>  does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers  (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or  click on a targeted advertisement meet the targeting criteria used to display  the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who travel).</p>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">Which Information Can I Access?</h3>
<p><?php echo $company_name; ?> gives you access to a broad  range of information about your account and your interactions with <?php echo $company_name; ?>  for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that  information.</p>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">What Choices Do I Have?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide  information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take  advantage of such <?php echo $company_name; ?> features as your Profile, Account  Management, Customer Reviews.</li>
    <li>You can add or update certain information. When you update  information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</li>
    <li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us,  please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences in &quot;My Preferences&quot;.  (If you do not want to receive Conditions of Use and other legal notices from  us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of <?php echo $company_name; ?>,  and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</li>
    <li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you  how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser  notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons,  such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the  Website of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take  advantage of some of <?php echo $company_name; ?>'s essential features, we recommend that  you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our  cookies, you will not be able to use any <?php echo $company_name; ?> products and  services that require you to Sign in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">Are Children Allowed to Use <?php echo $company_name; ?>?</h3>
<p>If you are under 18, you may use <?php echo $company_name; ?>  only with the involvement of a parent or guardian.</p>
<h3 style="color:<?php echo $terms_tx_color; ?>;">Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
<p>If you choose to visit <?php echo $company_name; ?>,  your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our  Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes,  and application of the law of the state of Washington. If you have any concern  about privacy at <?php echo $company_name; ?>, please contact us with a thorough  description, and we will try to resolve it.</p>
<p>Our business changes constantly, and our  Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may e-mail  periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us  not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes.  Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information  that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make,  however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make  them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the  consent of affected customers.</p>
